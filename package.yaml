synopsis: Types and parsers for software version numbers.
description: 'A library for parsing and comparing software version numbers.
             We like to give version numbers to our software in a myriad of
             ways. Some ways follow strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison.
             Some follow conventional wisdom and are generally self-consistent.
             Some are just plain asinine. This library provides a means of parsing
             and comparing /any/ style of versioning, be it a nice Semantic Version
             like this:


             > 1.2.3-r1+git123


             ...or a monstrosity like this:


             > 2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1


             Please switch to <http://semver.org Semantic Versioning> if you
             aren''t currently using it. It provides consistency in version
             incrementing and has the best constraints on comparisons.'
